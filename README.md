# Front-End Developer (task before first job)

I think everyone had issues with the first interview.
Every time there is a question in the head:
How to get ready?
Which task will be on interview?
Will I do that?
Panic... But don't worry :)
I picked up a few tasks for you, which will help you to get ready to interview.
